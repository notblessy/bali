# Bali Programming Language

## for research purpose

Welcome to the **Bali Programming Language**! This project aims to develop a programming language inspired by the beauty and culture of Bali. Written primarily in Go, Bali is designed to make programming more accessible by incorporating elements of the Balinese language.

## Features

- **Simple Syntax:** Bali emphasizes readability and simplicity, making it a great choice for beginners.
- **Cultural Integration:** Keywords and commands are inspired by the Balinese language, celebrating local culture.
- **Example Programs:** Check out the `example` folder to see Bali in action with sample programs!

## Installation

You can copy this & execute in terminal.

- If you're using bash, change the zsh first.

```zsh
$ zsh <(curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notblessy/bali-installer/refs/heads/main/install.sh)
```

## Usage

You can write your own Bali programs! Here’s a simple “Hello, World!” example:

```bali
margiang utama

pesuang("Om Swastiastu, semeton sami!")
```

Save this code into a file with a `example.bali` extension and run it using the compiler.

```
$ bali run ./example.bali
```

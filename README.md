## Installation

You can copy this & execute in terminal.

- If you're using bash, change the zsh first.

```zsh
$ zsh <(curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notblessy/bali-installer/refs/heads/main/install.sh)
```

## Usage

You can write your own Bali programs! Here’s a simple “Hello, World!” example:

```bali
margiang utama

pesuang("Om Swastiastu, semeton sami!")
```

Save this code into a file with a `example.bali` extension and run it using the compiler.

```
$ bali run ./example.bali
```
